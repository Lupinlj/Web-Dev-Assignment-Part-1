            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
               Joe Bakkersfield was always in the kitchen with his grandmother. They baked all sorts of baked goods together, starting from cakes, cookies, brownies, fudge, you name it. He loved spending time with his grandmother. Sadly, when Joe turned 14 years old, his grandmother passed away. This made Joe very miserable. He felt like the only person who understood him had left him. He felt all alone. One year later, Joe is still not over his grandmother's death. Found his grandmother's recipe book, with this book and still the love to bake, Joe started to bake delicious baked goods again. He made a promise to himself and his grandmother (from above) that he would turn her book into a legacy. He started working hard. Looking for part part-time job to make money and learn a new skill or two. This went on for 8 years. Joe finally saved up to start his own business, and so he did. He created Joe Bakes. He makes all sorts of delicious baked goods. This is where he will make his grandmother proud.
